Mastro is a static site generator and web framework built from first principles.
A simple file-based router, a handful of [composable functions](https://jsr.io/@mastrojs/mastro/doc) to return HTML and standard [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects. No magic, no config.
Mastro is mostly about what it doesn't have:

- **No bloat**: written in just [~700 lines](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/tree/main/src#readme) of TypeScript, Mastro is a framework distilled to its essence.
- **No bundler**: control exactly what code arrives in the browser.
- **No client-side JavaScript** by default: create lean websites that load blazingly fast.
- **No VC-money**: this forces us to stay lean ourselves, and prevents eventual enshitification.
- **No hosting offer** to sell you on: frankly, running a service is not what we're interested in.
- **No update treadmill**: we use the platform and [almost no dependencies](https://jsr.io/@mastrojs/mastro/dependencies), which allows us to keep things small and low-maintenance.

## Easy for beginners

With Mastro, there is very little to learn ‚Äì except for web standards: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Use the popular VS‚ÄäCode editor, which also runs in the browser: no need to install anything nor learn the terminal.

## Powerful for experienced developers

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Megabytes of JavaScript on fire in the browser. I watched towers of hard to debug abstractions collapse upon themselves. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to let them die.

Mastro offers you a clean slate to build on. [Install Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/), and either use the [template repo](https://github.com/mastrojs/template-basic-deno) or run:

```sh title=Terminal
deno run -A jsr:@mastrojs/mastro@0.1.3/init
```

## Fast for everyone

Mastro websites not only [load fast](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-mastrojs-github-io/3n7m0iioqk?form_factor=mobile), they are also generated quickly.

## Learn to work with the fabric of the web

Start with the fundamentals: HTML and CSS. Then build a static blog. Finally, explore two ways of implementing a to-do list app: once with plain JavaScript, then reactively.

While the guide uses Mastro, the patterns discussed are universal to web development.

## Reactive Mastro ‚Äì interactivity simplified

The final part of Mastro is a tiny (2.8k min.gz) client-side reactive GUI library for MPAs.
