A simple file-based [router](/guide/server-side-components-and-routing/#routing-and-page-handlers), a handful of [composable functions](https://jsr.io/@mastrojs/mastro/doc) to return [standard Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response) objects. Serve HTML, JSON, or whatever. No magic, no config.
Mastro gets out of the way, so that you can focus on building awesome websites.

- **No bloat**: written in just [~700 lines](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/tree/main/src#readme) of TypeScript, Mastro is a framework distilled to its essence.
- **No client-side JavaScript** (until you [add some](/guide/interactivity-with-javascript-in-the-browser/)): create lean [MPA](/guide/javascript/) websites that load blazingly [fast](#fast-for-everyone).
- **No bundler** (until you [add one](/guide/bundling-assets-caching/)): your code arrives in the browser exactly as you wrote it.
- **No magic**: use normal `<img>` and `<a>` tags referencing HTTP-first [assets](/guide/bundling-assets-caching/#transforming-images).
- **No VC-money**: this forces us to stay lean ourselves, and prevents eventual enshitification.
- **No hosting offer** to sell you on: frankly, running a service is not what we're interested in.
- **No update treadmill**: we use web standards and virtually no [dependencies](https://jsr.io/@mastrojs/mastro/dependencies), which allows us to keep things small and low-maintenance.

## Easy for beginners ‚Äì no installation needed

With Mastro, there is very little to learn ‚Äì except for the web standards HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The popular VS‚ÄäCode editor also runs in the browser: put your first website live without installing anything on your computer.

## Powerful for experienced developers

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Megabytes of JavaScript on fire in the browser. I watched towers of hard to debug abstractions collapse upon themselves. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to let them die.

```sh title=Terminal
deno run -A jsr:@mastrojs/mastro@0.2.1/init
```

Start with the [template repo](https://github.com/mastrojs/template-basic-deno), run the above in a terminal, or see [installation instructions](/guide/setup-mastro-cli-or-server/#setup-a-local-server).

## Learn web development ‚Äì from fundamentals to advanced techniques

Work with the fabric of the web instead of fighting it. Start with the fundamentals: HTML and CSS. Then build a static blog, and implement a to-do list app: once with plain JavaScript, then reactively. Finally, run a server with a REST API, and learn about caching and different architectures.

While the guide uses Mastro, the patterns discussed are universal to web development.

## Reactive Mastro ‚Äì interactivity simplified

The final part of Mastro is a tiny (2.8k min.gz) client-side reactive GUI library for MPAs.
