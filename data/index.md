Static site generation and on-demand rendering of HTML or JSON ‚Äì it all works exactly the same in Mastro: a file-based [router](/guide/server-side-components-and-routing/#routing-and-page-handlers), and a handful of [composable functions](https://jsr.io/@mastrojs/mastro/doc) to return standard [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response) objects.
No magic, no config ‚Äì just focus on building awesome websites.

- **No bloat**: written in just [~700 lines](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/tree/main/src#readme) of TypeScript, Mastro is a framework distilled to its essence.
- **No client-side JavaScript** (until you [add some](/guide/interactivity-with-javascript-in-the-browser/)): create [MPA](/guide/client-side-vs-server-side-javascript-static-vs-ondemand-spa-vs-mpa/) websites that load blazingly [fast](#fast-for-everyone).
- **No bundler** (until you [add one](/guide/bundling-assets-caching/)): your code arrives in the browser exactly how you wrote it.
- **No magic**: use normal `<img>` and `<a>` tags referencing HTTP-first [assets](/guide/bundling-assets-caching/#transforming-images).
- **No VC-money**: this forces us to stay lean and prevents eventual enshitification.
- **No hosting offer**: selling a service is not what we're interested in.
- **No update treadmill**: we use web standards instead of relying on many [dependencies](https://jsr.io/@mastrojs/mastro/dependencies).
- **No lock-in**: if you don't like some aspect of Mastro, just fork the code ‚Äì it's only [~700 lines](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/tree/main/src#readme) after all.

## Easy for beginners ‚Äì no installation needed

With Mastro, there is very little to learn ‚Äì except for the web standards HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The popular VS‚ÄäCode editor also runs in the browser: put your first website live without installing anything on your computer.

## Experienced developers ‚Äì do you want off the frontend treadmill?

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Megabytes of JavaScript on fire in the browser. I watched towers of hard to debug abstractions collapse upon themselves. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to let them die.

There are [various way to run Mastro](/guide/cli-install/). If you're unsure which runtime to pick, we recommend [Deno](https://deno.com).

<div class="col3">

- **Deno** ¬†([template](https://github.com/mastrojs/template-basic-deno))

  ```sh
  deno run -A npm:@mastrojs/create-mastro@latest
  ```

- **Node.js** ¬†([template](https://github.com/mastrojs/template-basic-node))

  ```sh
  pnpm create @mastrojs/mastro@latest
  ```

- **Bun** ¬†([template](https://github.com/mastrojs/template-basic-bun))

  ```sh
  bun create @mastrojs/mastro@latest
  ```

## Learn web development ‚Äì from fundamentals to advanced techniques

Work with the fabric of the web instead of fighting it. Start with the fundamentals: HTML and CSS. Then build a static blog, and implement a to-do list app: once with plain JavaScript, then reactively. Finally, run a server with a REST API, and learn about caching and different architectures.

## Reactive Mastro ‚Äì interactivity simplified

The final part of Mastro is a tiny (2.8k min.gz) client-side reactive GUI library for MPAs.
