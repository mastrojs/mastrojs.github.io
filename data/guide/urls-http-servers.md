title: URLs, HTTP and servers
---

During this whole guide so far, you've been using Mastro as a static site generator: when you hit the "Generate" button, it creates the html files, which GitHub Pages exposes to the web somehow. But how? What actually happens when you hit enter in your web browser after typing in some URL like `https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/`?

Broadly speaking, your browser makes a request to a server, and that server sends back the HTML. A server is ultimately a computer that usually sits in a data center, and is running a program that answers these requests. Confusingly, that program is also called a server.


## Anatomy of a URL

Let's take a closer look at the above URL. It consists of three parts:

1. `https` (known as the _scheme_) tells us that we will use the HTTP protocol to talk to the server (actually HTTPS – HTTP but securely encrypted).
2. `mastrojs.github.io` is the _host_ part of the URL: it identifies which server on the internet to send the request to. It consists of three parts in turn:
    - `.io` is the top-level domain (the most famous TLD is `.com`)
    - `github.io` is known as the domain
    - `mastrojs` is the subdomain (the most common subdomain is `www`)
3. `/guide/` is the _path_ – it tells the server which page we'd like to see.

Actually, there can be a few more things in a [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL):

We'll get to the _port_ and the _parameters_ later. The _anchor_ is the only part of the URL that's not sent to the server, it merely allows the browser to scroll directly to the element with the `id` specified in the anchor (sometimes also known as a hash). You can see it in action when clicking a link in the table of contents of a larger Wikipedia article, for example.


## An HTTP request and response

Now, to actually send a message over the internet to that specific server, the browser needs to know the server's IP address, which is a long number that's hard for humans to remember. To find it, the browser does a lookup in the so-called Domain Name System (DNS). If you want your website to be availlable under a custom domain (instead of a subdomain of github.io), you need to pay a registrar, like Hover, to register it in the Domain Name System. (I wouldn't recomend GoDaddy, which features some dark UI patterns.)

The HTTP request that your browser (aka the client) sends to the server when you hit enter might look something like this:

```http
GET /guide/ HTTP/1.1
Host: mastrojs.github.io
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Mac OS X 10.15) Firefox/139.0
Accept: text/html
Accept-Language: en-GB
```

It's a HTTP `GET` request for the `/guide/` page, using version `1.1` of the `HTTP` protocol. The `Host` HTTP header field mentions the server's hostname, the `User-Agent` header identifies the browser making the request: in this case Mozilla Firefox on Mac OS X. The last two headers let the server know that we'd like the response to be HTML, and preferably in English as spoken in Great Britain.

If all goes well, the server answers with an HTTP response. It starts with the response headers, followed by an empty empty line, followed by the response body containing the HTML. Thus it might start as follows:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: text/html
last-modified: Mon, 23 Jun 2025 13:07:45 GMT
content-length: 6172

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
```

Notice the `200 OK` on the first line? `200` is the HTTP response status code for "OK" – meaning the server understood the request and managed to send a response. Apart from success, [status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status) fall into three classes:

- `3xx` (like `301` or `303`) are [redirects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Redirections).
- `4xx` means something went wrong and the server thinks it's the client's fault. The most common one is `404 Not Found`, which means the server does not have the page which the client requested.
- `5xx` means the server ran into some kind of problem when trying to answer. Perhaps it was overloaded or crashed due to a programming error.

As you can see, loading an actual website over the internet is way more complex than opening a static HTML file stored on your laptop's harddisk. It's a dynamic process, involving a sort of negotiation between the client (usually the browser) and the server, and can lead to different results depending on the systems currently online and how they're configured.
