title: "Setup: GitHub, VS Code and Mastro"
---

There are various ways to run Mastro, which is a general-purpose web framework and static site generator. The by far easiest way is with the Mastro _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ extension, which lets you run Mastro as a static site generator right in your browser. No need to install anything or learn how to use the command line.

:::tip
## Alternative option: command line

If you're already comfortable with the command line and prefer a local installation over _VS Code for the Web_, you can [setup Mastro on the command line](/guide/setup-mastro-cli-or-server/#different-ways-to-run-mastro).

Once you've done that, you can jump to the [next chapter](/guide/html/).

Either way, since all the processing happens upfront, and the generated files are served from a CDN close to your users, a static site is extremely fast and secure.
We'll be using GitHub Pages, which hosts your static site for free.


## Create a new _GitHub_ repository

If you want, you can buy and [configure a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) later. But by default, GitHub Pages will publish your website for free under:

    https://your-user-name.github.io/your-repository-name/

1. [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). Choose your username wisely, because it will show up in lots of places. Ideally, something relatively short that's still available.

2.  Create a new GitHub repository to store your project's files:

    - Open Mastro's [basic template repository](https://github.com/mastrojs/template-basic).
    - In the upper right, click the green button **Use this template**, and from the dropdown select **Create a new repository**.
    - Choose a repository name (something short and descriptive like `blog`, or `cooking-website`, or even the domain name of your future website), and click **Create repository**.


## Open _Visual Studio Code for the Web_

Now that you're on your repository's page on GitHub:

1. press the `.` key on your computer's keyboard to open the _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ editor. Alternatively, you can go to `https://github.dev/your-user-name/your-repository-name/` (this is the same address you're already on, but instead of `github.com`, it uses `github.dev`).
2. When prompted about signing in using GitHub, click the _Allow_ button.
3. To select your GitHub user, press `enter` in the small dialog that opens.

  If you've selected "Strict" in the "Enhanced Tracking Protection" preferences, you need to temporarily disable it, in order to connect VS Code with GitHub the first time around.

## Install the _Mastro_ extension

1. Click **Install** in the small dialog in the bottom right that says "Do you want to install the recommended extensions from mastro and FAST for this repository?"
2. Click **Trust Publishers & Install**
3. Close the two tabs of the just installed extensions ([Mastro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mastro.mastro-vscode-extension) and [FAST Tagged Template Literals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-fast.fast-tagged-templates)).

Done? Congrats, you're all set up now! You can switch back to the _Explorer_ view (the topmost icon in the activity bar on the left) to finally write some HTML.
