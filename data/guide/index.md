Build your first website and put it live – all in your browser.
Start with the fundamentals: HTML and CSS. Then build a static blog, and implement a to-do list app: once with plain JavaScript, then reactively. Finally, run a server with a REST API, and learn about caching and different architectures.

While the guide uses the Mastro framework, the patterns discussed are universal.

This guide does not show you everything you’ll ever need to know when creating websites.
Instead, it shows you the door to the world of web design.
It gives you an overview over the landscape, kick-starts you with practical examples,
and tells you where to learn more once you need to.

Each chapter builds on the previous. If you already know semantic HTML, classless CSS and JavaScript,
you can [do the setup](/guide/setup/) and then skip ahead to [publishing your website](/guide/publish-website/).
But if the only HTML elements you know are `<div>` and `<span>`, it's best to start with the fundamentals.
