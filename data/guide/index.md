Learn the fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
by building your very first website and putting it live – all in your browser.

This guide does not show you everything you’ll ever need to know when creating websites.
Instead, it shows you the door to the world of web design.
It gives you an overview over the landscape, kick-starts you with practical examples,
and tells you where to learn more once you need to.

While the guide uses the Mastro framework, the patterns discussed are universal.
Each chapter builds on the previous. If you already know semantic HTML, classless CSS and JavaScript
you can [do the setup](/guide/setup/) and then skip ahead to [publishing your website](/publish-website/).
But if the only HTML you know are `<div>` and `<span>`, it's best to start with the fundamentals.
