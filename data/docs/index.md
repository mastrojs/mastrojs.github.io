Mastro builds on web standards as much as possible. Read about the HTML, CSS and JavaScript features built into modern browsers and runtimes on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/baseline-evolution-on-mdn/).
Mastro then provides the few missing pieces: a router, a way to generate HTML, and scripts for static site generation and starting a server – implemented in just [~700 lines](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/tree/main/src#readme).
