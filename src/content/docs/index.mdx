People building websites have been called lots of things: webmaster, web designer, frontend engineer.
What has stayed the same since 1991, is that to create truly great websites,
you need to care about your users, and you need to handcraft your HTML and CSS.

Mastro is a *m*inimal *Astro*-like web framework that provides you
simple abstractions to write HTML, CSS and JS –
without any complex tools messing with your code before it reaches the browser.


### The Mastro Guide

Free introductory guide to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with accompanying [_Visual Studio Code for the Web_ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mastro.mastro-vscode-extension)
to generate your static site and publish it to GitHub Pages – all in your browser.

<LinkButton href="/guide/">Build and publish your first website</LinkButton>

### The Mastro web framework

An minimal (~700 lines of TypeScript) server and static site generator built from first principles.
Zero client-side JavaScript by default and no bundler.
See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/) for more info and examples.
To start a new Mastro project, install [Deno](https://deno.com/) and run:

```
deno run --allow-write jsr:@mastrojs/mastro@0.0.5/init
```

### Reactive Mastro

A tiny (2.8k min.gz) client-side reactive GUI library for your Mastro project, or for your existing MPA.
