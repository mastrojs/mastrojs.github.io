People building websites have been called lots of things: webmaster, web designer, frontend engineer.
What has stayed the same since 1991, is that to create truly great websites,
you need to care about your users, and you need to handcraft your HTML and CSS.

Mastro is a *m*inimal *Astro*-like web framework that gives you
simple abstractions to write HTML, CSS and JS –
without any complex tools messing with your code before it reaches the browser.


### The Mastro Guide

Free introductory guide to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### SSG with VS Code in your browser

The Mastro _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ extension lets your run the
Mastro static site generator (SSG) right in your browser
– including publishing your website to GitHub Pages for free.

### The Mastro web framework

An minimal (~700 lines of TypeScript) server-side web framework and static site generator built from first principles.
Zero client-side JavaScript by default and no bundler. Runs on [Deno](https://deno.com/) (Bun, Node.js and CloudFlare Workers are in the works).
See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/) for more info and examples.
To start a new Mastro project, paste the following into your terminal:

```
deno run --allow-write jsr:@mastrojs/mastro@0.0.5/init
```

### Reactive Mastro
