A *m*inimal *Astro*-like MPA web framework for handcrafted websites.
There are three parts to it:


### The Mastro Guide

Guide to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with accompanying [_Visual Studio Code for the Web_ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mastro.mastro-vscode-extension)
‚Äì all you need is a browser and a GitHub account.

<LinkButton href="/guide/">Build and publish your first website</LinkButton>

### The Mastro web framework

A modern server and static site generator built from first principles.
Zero client-side JavaScript by default and no bundler ‚Äì see the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/).
To start a new Mastro project with [Deno](https://deno.com/), run:

```
deno run --allow-write jsr:@mastrojs/mastro@0.0.5/init
```

### Reactive Mastro

A tiny client-side reactive GUI library for your Mastro project, or for your existing MPA.

<LinkButton href="/reactive/">Get started</LinkButton>


## Why Mastro?

> A painter needs to know about paint.\
> A smith needs to know about iron.\
> A cook needs to know about plants, herbs and meat.\
> A "webmastro" needs to know about HTML and CSS.

Over the last three decades, people building websites have been calling themselves lots of things:
webmaster, web designer, web developer, frontend engineer.
What has stayed the same since 1991, is that to create truly great websites,
you need to handcraft the HTML and CSS.

That's what Mastro is all about:
providing you the essential abstractions to simply write HTML, CSS and JS ‚Äì
without any complex tools messing with your code before it reaches the browser.
