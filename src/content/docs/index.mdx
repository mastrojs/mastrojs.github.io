_Mastro_ is a *m*inimal take on an *Astro*-like MPA web framework. Currently, there are three parts to it:

- [The Mastro Guide](/guides/) and accompanying [_Visual Studio Code for the Web_ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mastro.mastro-vscode-extension) that teach you how to build and publish your first webside – using only a browser and a GitHub account.
- [The Mastro web framework](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/) (server and static site generator) – work-in-progress, currently focusing on getting it running in Deno.
- [Reactive Mastro](/reactive/) – a tiny reactive GUI library for your existing MPA.
