## Learn to work with the fabric of the web

Start with the fundamentals: HTML and CSS. Then build a static blog.
And finally, explore two ways to implement a to-do list app: once with plain JavaScript, then reactively.

## Craft websites with care

> A woodworker cares about wood – no cheap plastics.\
> A cook cares about plants and meat – no fast food.\
> A "webmastro" cares about HTML and CSS – no bloat.

Most of today’s websites are drowning in a sea of JavaScript.
Instead of looking after their users, developers are busy
fighting complex tooling like bundlers, and
are stuck on a treadmill of ever changing dependencies.
Mastro is here to show a different path.
If you care about the web, spread the word!


## Web framework that grows with you

Mastro is not just a static site generator. It's a *m*inimal *Astro*-like framework from first principles.

- **No bloat**: written in just [~700 lines](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/tree/main/src#readme) of TypeScript,
  Mastro is a framework distilled to its essence, loading fast even within VS Code or the edge. If you ever outgrow it, simply fork and adjust it.
- **No bundler** and full control over your HTML, CSS and JS. Mastro gives you composable functions,
instead of complex tooling that messes with your code before it reaches the browser.
- **No client-side JavaScript** by default: create lean websites that load blazingly fast.

Give it a try! To start a new project, [install Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)
and either use the [template repo](https://github.com/mastrojs/template-basic-deno) or run:

```
deno run -A jsr:@mastrojs/mastro@0.1.0/init
```

## Reactive Mastro – interactivity simplified

The final part of Mastro is a tiny (2.8k min.gz) client-side reactive GUI library for MPAs.
