This free guide teaches you enough of the fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to get you started, and shows you where to learn more once you need it.

Learning by doing: build your very first website and put it live ‚Äì all you need is a browser.* (How? you'll be using _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ to write, and _GitHub Pages_ to host your website.)
