### DIY craft kit for people that care about websites

> A painter cares about pigments and paper.\
> A cook cares about plants, herbs and meat.\
> A "webmastro" cares about HTML and CSS.

Since 1991, people building websites have been called lots of things: webmaster, web designer, frontend engineer.
What has stayed the same, is that to create truly great websites,
you need to care about your users, and you need to care about your HTML and CSS.


### The Mastro Guide

Introductory guide to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Learn how to handcraft a website and publish it to GitHub Pages for free – all from within your browser.

### The static site generator that runs in your browser

The Mastro _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ extension generates a website right in your browser.

### The web framework that grows with you

Mastro is also a *m*inimal *Astro*-like framework and static site generator built from first principles.

- **No bundler** and full control over your HTML, CSS and JS. Mastro gives you composable functions
and no complex tooling messing with your code before it reaches the browser.
- **No client-side JavaScript**: create lean websites, that load blazingly fast.
- **No bloat**: written in just [~700 lines](https://github.com/mastrojs/mastro/) of TypeScript, Mastro is easy to fork and adapt. It runs either
  [in a VS Code extension](#the-static-site-generator-that-runs-in-your-browser),
  or on Deno (Node.js, Bun and Workers are in the works).

Give it a try! To start a new Mastro project using the command line, [install Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)
and run:

```
deno run --allow-write jsr:@mastrojs/mastro@0.0.5/init
```
