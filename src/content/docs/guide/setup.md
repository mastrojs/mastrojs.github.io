The Mastro _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ extension lets your run the
Mastro static site generator (SSG) right in your browser
â€“ including publishing your website to GitHub Pages for free.


## Create a new _GitHub_ repository

To make your website accessible to the whole internet, you'll need to store and publish it somewhere. We'll be using _GitHub Pages_ for that. If you want, you can buy and [configure a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) later. But by default, GitHub will publish your website for free under:

    https://your-user-name.github.io/your-repository-name/

1. [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). Choose your username wisely, because it will show up in lots of places. Ideally, something relatively short that's still available.

2. [Create a new repository](https://github.com/new). A repository is where you will store your project's files. The only field you need to change is the _Repository name_: call it something short and descriptive like `blog`, or `cooking-website`, or even the domain name of your future website (like `cooking.com`) if you have reserved one already. Then click _Create repository_.


## Open _Visual Studio Code for the Web_

Now that you're on your repository's page on GitHub:

1. press the `.` key on your computer's keyboard to open the _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ editor. Alternatively, you can go to `https://github.dev/your-user-name/your-repository-name/` (this is the same address you're already on, but instead of `github.com`, it uses `github.dev`).
2. When prompted about signing in using GitHub, click the _Allow_ button.
3. To select your GitHub user, press `enter` in the small dialog that opens.

## Install the _Mastro_ extension

The _Mastro_ static site generator (SSG) is special in that it can also run as a VS Code extension in your browser. That way you don't have to install a runtime like Node.js or Deno on your computer, and you don't have to mess around with the terminal and command line.

Install the following two VS Code extensions. In the _Activity Bar_ on the left, click the _Extensions_ icon (looks like four blocks with one flying away).

- Install [Mastro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mastro.mastro-vscode-extension) by searching for `mastro` (it should be the first search result, the one with the picture of a cook) and click _Install_. Click _Trust Publisher & Install_ when prompted.
- Install [FAST Tagged Template Literals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-fast.fast-tagged-templates) by searching for `fast-tagged-templates`.

Done? Congrats, you're all set up now! You can switch back to the _Explorer_ view (the topmost icon in the activity bar on the left) to finally write some HTML.
