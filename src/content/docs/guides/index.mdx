Learn the basics of the fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
by building your very first website and putting it live ‚Äì all in your browser.*

(How? By using _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ to write, and _GitHub Pages_ to host your website.)

This free guide does not show you everything you‚Äôll ever need to know when creating websites.
Instead, it shows you the door to the world of web design.
It gives you an overview over the landscape, kick-starts you with practical examples,
and tells you where to learn more once you need to.
