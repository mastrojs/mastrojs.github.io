This free guide teaches you the basics of the fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It does not show you everything you‚Äôll ever need to know when creating a website.
Rather, it aims to show you the door, giving you a broad overview over the landscape of
web development, kick-starts you with practical examples, and shows you where to learn
more once you need it.

Learning by doing: build your very first website and put it live ‚Äì all you need is a browser.* (How? you'll be using _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ to write, and _GitHub Pages_ to host your website.)
