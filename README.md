# The Mastro Guide üë®‚Äçüç≥

Repo for the https://mastrojs.github.io website.

Because of the syntax highlighting and other niceties that are already built in, we're currently using [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) for this website.

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
